# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktails <- read_tsv("https://raw.github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}

cocktails_t <- cocktails %>%
    separate_rows("ingredients", sep = "<br>") %>%
    separate_rows("ingredients", sep = "<br/>") %>%
    separate_rows("ingredients", sep = "<b>")%>%
    separate_rows("ingredients", sep = "<b4/>")


  
cocktails_clean <- cocktails_t %>%
     mutate(ingredients_clean = str_remove_all(ingredients, "[:digit:]") %>%
     str_remove_all("oz") %>%
     str_remove_all("drops") %>%
     str_remove_all("es") %>%
     str_remove_all("bsp") %>%
     str_remove_all("cr\u008fme") %>%
     str_remove_all("dash") %>%
     str_remove_all("%") %>%
     str_remove_all("(. abv)") %>%
     str_remove_all("[(]")%>%
     str_remove_all("[)]")%>%
     str_remove_all("[/]") %>%
     str_remove_all("[.]")%>%
     str_squish()) 
  
  kable(str_to_lower(cocktails_clean$ingredients_clean))

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients_list <- cocktails_clean %>%
     arrange(ingredients_clean)
unique(ingredients_list$ingredients_clean)%>%
  str_to_lower()%>%
  kable()
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
kable(n_distinct(cocktails_clean$ingredients_clean))
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
ing_sort <- as.data.frame(sort(table(cocktails_clean$ingredients_clean),decreasing=TRUE))

kable(sort(table(cocktails_clean$ingredients_clean),decreasing=TRUE)[1:tail(which(ing_sort$Freq == unique(ing_sort$Freq)[10]), 1)], col.names = c("ingredients", "frequency"))
  

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
sort(table(cocktails_clean$name), decreasing=T)

cocktails_n <- cocktails_clean %>%
     group_by(name) %>%
     mutate(freq=n())%>%
     arrange(desc(freq))

unique(cocktails_n$name)

max_ingredients <- cocktails_n %>%
    filter(freq == max(cocktails_n$freq))

kable(unique(max_ingredients$name))

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
sort(table(cocktails_clean$ingredients_clean), decreasing = F)
ingredients_n <- cocktails_clean %>%
     group_by(ingredients_clean) %>%
     mutate(freq=n())%>%
     arrange(desc(freq))

unique_ingredients <- ingredients_n %>%
          filter(freq == min(ingredients_n$freq))
kable(n_distinct(unique_ingredients$name))

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
kable(str_to_lower(unique(unique_ingredients$name)))
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
nonunique_ingredients <- ingredients_n %>%
     filter(freq > 1)
kable(unique(nonunique_ingredients $name))

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
print("No idea, sorry...")

```

```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
